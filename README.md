# Lesson 06: Array

## Code Description:

This is a Python script that demonstrates various array-related operations, such as:

- Creating and manipulating lists
- Checking membership and indexing
- Slicing and sorting
- Removing and inserting elements
- Using tuples to store data
- Converting between lists and tuples
- Using count() method on tuples

## Code Purpose:

This code is a tutorial or educational script that teaches the basics of working with arrays (lists and tuples) in Python. It provides examples and explanations for various array-related operations, making it suitable for beginners learning Python programming.

The code starts by creating two lists, users and data, and performs various operations on them, such as checking membership, indexing, slicing, sorting, removing, inserting, and converting to tuples. The script also uses tuples to store data and demonstrates how to use the count() method.

Overall, this code aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of array-related concepts in Python, making it an excellent resource for learning Python programming fundamentals.
